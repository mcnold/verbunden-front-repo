Project Description
Verbunden concierge is a mobile application that acts like a mobile travel guide. Users can connect via video to a local SME who is able to provide recommendations, ideas, sightseeing tips, etc. like a hotel concierge from the app. Verbunden will offer a list of local activities available based on location data. A user can add favorite spots based on his or her latitude and longitude coordinates.
